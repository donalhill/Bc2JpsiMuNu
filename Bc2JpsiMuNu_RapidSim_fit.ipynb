        "# Fitting the $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$ RapidSim MC angular distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we perform a 3D fit to the anglular distribution of the $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$ decay. Our goal is to measure the helicity amplitudes which parameterise the decay. The angular distribution is defined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06956.pdf) Table I. The values of the helicity parameters we measure will correspond to those used to generate the $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$ RapidSim MC. In real life, we would want to measure these parameters in real data, to understand the underlying physics of the decay.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The helicity amplitudes \n",
        "\n",
        "The helicity amplitudes $H$ are complex numbers with a magnitude and a phase each. By convention, we have:\n",
        " - Three helicity amplitudes called $H_0$, $H_+$, and $H_-$.\n",
        " - These helicity amplitudes have magnitudes $|H_0|$, $|H_+|$, and $|H_-|$. They are related by the expression $|H_0|^2 + |H_-|^2 + |H_+|^2 = 1$, which means we only need to measure two of these magnitudes in order to know all three.\n",
        " - Each helicity amplitude also has a phase, so we have $\\phi_0$, $\\phi_+$, and $\\phi_-$. One of these is not physically meaningful, as only relative phases are observable. So in practice we set $\\phi_0 = 0$, and then measure $\\phi_+$ and $\\phi_-$ relative to this. In practice, non-zero values for these phases represent interference between the $H_{+/-}$ helicity amplitudes and the $H_0$ one. "

The angular distributions above are perfect MC-truth, which we would be able to measure with a magic detector that could detect neutrinos and also measure all the particle 4-momenta with perfect precision. \n",

In addition, we also don't measure the three muons produced in the decay with perfect precision. To understand how these issues impact our measurement, we can look at some $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$ MC events which have passed through a simulation of the LHCb detector."
