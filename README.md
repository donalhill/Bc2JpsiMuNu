# Bc2JpsiMuNu
This repository contains notebooks for the analysis of Bc -> J/psi mu nu Monte Carlo. The notebooks were created using Google Colab, and they use ROOT MC files stored in my own Google Drive. Using Colab means we don't need to worry about any Python environment setup, and it also lets us run some commands on the command line to install packages we need. For further work, you are welcome to use Google Colab notebooks, Jupyter notebooks, or write your own Python scripts and executre them in a terminal.
